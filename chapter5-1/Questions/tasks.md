2. You are creating a new account and need to provide a password. The password has the following requirements:
(a) The password must be at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters.
(b) It must contain at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one number.
Write a program that prompts the user to input a password and checks if the password is valid. If the password is valid, print a confirmation statement. If it is not, print a statement that the password is not valid.

3. Using the incredible power of the human mind, according to research at Cambridge University, it doesn't matter in what order the letters in a word are, the only important thing is that the first and last letter be in the right place. The rest can be total mess and you can still read it without a problem. This is because the human mind does not read every letter by itself, but the word as a whole. Amazing, huh? Yeah and I always thought spelling was important! Write a program that prompts for a word and prints the scrambled version (with first and last fixed).
Hint: The random module helps scramble words.

4. Develop a Python program that will: (1) prompt for input, (2) extract all the vowels in the input string and make them lowercase, (3) add all the nonduplicate vowels you found into a temporary string, and (4) stop the code when you have collected all five vowels (aeiou) and print the number of trials that you did to collect all five vowel characters.
